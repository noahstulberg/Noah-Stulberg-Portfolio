/*
Email Campaign Analysis Portfolio Project:

Problem Statement: Analyze the effectiveness of various email campaigns conducted by a company.

Database Creation:

Set up a database that records:

- Customer details (id, age, gender, location, etc.)
- Email campaigns (id, start date, end date, campaign theme)
- Customer actions on each email (customer_id, campaign_id, email_opened, link_clicked, purchase_made, etc.)
